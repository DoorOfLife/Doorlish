# Doorlish

Doorlish is a curated extension of the English language, thus its words and terms have explicit and specific definitions. 

Where Doorlish adds new words, the words compliment and extend common English. Where Doorlish defines words that are already part of the English language, Doorlish overrides the English definitions and takes precedence. A speaker of Doorlish may specify that they are currently using the Doorlish extension by saying or writing the meta-word 'Schmu'. If two or more communicating parties have agreed to use Doorlish, 'Schmu' may be omitted.
